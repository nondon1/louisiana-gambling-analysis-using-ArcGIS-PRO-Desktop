# Louisiana Gambling Analysis Using ArcGIS Pro Desktop

This project presents a comprehensive spatial analysis of **gambling establishments across Louisiana** using **ArcGIS Pro Desktop**. It visualizes how gambling locations are distributed across the state's ten Human Services Districts and explores patterns by type of gambling and parish-level legalization status.

## 🗺️ Figure 4.1: Gambling Establishments and Human Services Regions in Louisiana

This map illustrates the state of **Louisiana divided into ten distinct Human Services Districts/Authorities**, each represented by a different color. These districts align with regional administrative boundaries and are labeled according to their respective service areas, including entities such as the **Metropolitan Human Services District**, **Capital Area Human Services District**, and **Florida Parishes Human Services Authority**, among others.

Overlaying these districts are numerous **black dots**, each representing a **licensed gambling establishment** within the state. The spatial distribution of these dots clearly indicates areas with a **high concentration of gambling activities**, often forming visible clusters. These clusters suggest **gambling-prone regions**, which are more prominently located in areas like the **southern and central parts** of the state, where urban development and accessibility via major highways such as **I-10, I-20, I-49, and I-55** support higher engagement.

This visualization highlights the **geographic correlation between gambling activity and human services regions**, offering valuable insights for **policymakers, researchers, and public health officials** addressing gambling behavior and its associated social impacts.

## 📊 Figures 4.2 – 4.11: Regional Breakdown of Gambling Establishments Across Louisiana

Figures 4.2 through 4.11 provide a detailed breakdown of **gambling establishments across each of the ten Human Services Regions in Louisiana**. Within each region, establishments are mapped by **parish**, illustrating the spread and concentration of gambling activity.

While most regions contain several parishes with active gambling operations, it is important to note that some parishes are designated as **non-gambling parishes**, where gambling is **not legalized under state law**. These areas are easily identifiable on the maps due to the **absence of gambling locations**.

Each figure also distinguishes between **different types of gambling**—such as **casinos, video poker, and racetracks**—using **unique color codes**. This visual categorization allows for:

- ✅ Clear identification of the **types and density** of gambling within each region  
- ✅ Recognition of **parishes with high gambling activity**  
- ✅ Inference of **probable cross-parish travel**, where residents of non-gambling parishes may travel to nearby legalized areas to participate in gambling  

This regional breakdown enhances our understanding of the **geographic and legal landscape** of gambling in Louisiana, offering valuable insights for **public health planning, legal regulation, and socio-economic analysis**.
